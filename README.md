[Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/) [(firebase-tools)](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) plugin for [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com). Manage your Firebase CLI without Node.js or npm global installs! Great for pinning your firebase version across the team and for `python`, `golang`, `c++` & `java` Firebase projects.

See `.tool-versions` configuration in the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-configuration?id=tool-versions) documentation to manage all your project's tools in one place!

# Why?

`firebase-tools` is a CLI tool for all Firebase projects, regardless of language. To date, the methods for installation have been downloading the CLI from the Firebase website or through `npm`, with `npm` being the primary method advertised.

With `asdf` and the `asdf-firebase` plugin, users/teams of any Firebase project can install and pin the version of the Firebase CLI without needing to manage Node.js or `npm`!

# Contributing

Contributions of any kind welcome! See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why are there Node deps here?

I decided the value of [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) & sharing Git Hooks with [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) were greater than the cost of including these deps. Not only this, but dogfooding `asdf` for dev deps makes this less of an issue.
