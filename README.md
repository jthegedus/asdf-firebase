# Why?

`firebase-tools` is a CLI tool for all Firebase projects, regardless of language. To date, the methods for installation have been downloading the CLI from the Firebase website or through `npm`, with `npm` being the primary method advertised.

Installing Node.js just to install a CLI tool via `npm` is cumbersome.

With `asdf` and the `asdf-firebase` plugin, users/teams of any **non**-Node.js Firebase project can install pin the version of the Firebase CLI without needing to manage Node.js or `npm`!
